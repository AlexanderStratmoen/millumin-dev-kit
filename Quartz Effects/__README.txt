1- Copy these files into the folder "/Users/username/Library/Graphics/Millumin/" (create the folder if needed)
2- Restart Millumin
3- You can now use these custom Quartz effects in "Effects" section of Millumin

Feel free to edit these files and create new effects. You just need to install Quartz Composer (see OSX DVD).
